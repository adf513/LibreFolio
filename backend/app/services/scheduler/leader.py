    Determine if the current process is the scheduler leader.

    Strategy for multi-worker uvicorn (--workers N):
      Among sibling worker processes (children of the uvicorn master),
      the one with the lowest PID is the leader. Re-evaluated every tick
      for self-healing (if leader crashes, next tick promotes new lowest-PID).

      - PID 1 or no parent (Docker single-container)
      - Parent is the uvicorn master with --reload (dev mode, single logical worker)
      - Exception during introspection (safe: jobs are idempotent)

# 📊 Dashboard

The Dashboard is your **portfolio's command center** — a single screen that tells you what your portfolio is worth, how it's performing, and where your money is allocated.

## 🎛️ Date Range & Broker Filter

At the top of the dashboard you can select:

- **Time range** — presets from 1 week to All-Time, or a custom range via the date picker
- **Broker filter** — show all brokers or focus on one or more
- **Target currency** — converts all values into a single currency

!!! tip "Scope matters"

    When you filter to a single broker, cash transfers *to other brokers* become external flows for that scope. This affects [Deposited Capital](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/deposited-capital.md) and [P&L](../../financial-theory/technical-analysis/performance-metrics/period-pnl.md) calculations.

## 🌡️ Data Quality Banner

If any prices or FX rates are missing on the end date, a banner appears at the top explaining which assets could not be valued. Assets without a price provider (entered manually, such as real-estate crowdfunding projects) are permanently valued at purchase cost — this is intentional and does not generate a warning.

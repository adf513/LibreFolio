    """Compute FIFO open and closed lots from a list of BUY/SELL transactions.

    Algorithm:
    1. Sort transactions by date ascending (then by id for determinism).
    2. BUY → push onto deque (FIFO queue).
    3. SELL → consume from front of deque:
       - If the front lot has enough remaining qty → partial match, lot stays in queue.
       - If the front lot is exhausted → remove it, continue to next.
    4. Remaining deque entries = open_lots.

    Args:

    Returns:

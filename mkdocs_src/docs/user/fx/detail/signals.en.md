# 📈 Signals

The Signals panel lets you overlay **technical indicators** on the FX chart. These are computed in real-time from the exchange rate data and help you identify trends, momentum shifts, and volatility patterns.

## 📊 Available Indicators

### 📉 [EMA — Exponential Moving Average](../../../financial-theory/technical-indicators.md#ema)

Smooths daily rate noise to reveal the **underlying trend**. In FX, an EMA crossing above the rate line often suggests a weakening base currency (or strengthening quote currency). Configurable period: shorter = more reactive, longer = smoother.

### 📊 [MACD — Moving Average Convergence Divergence](../../../financial-theory/technical-indicators.md#macd)

Measures the **momentum** by computing the difference between a fast and a slow EMA. A positive MACD means the fast EMA is above the slow EMA (bullish), negative means the opposite (bearish). Useful in FX for detecting trend reversals and momentum shifts.

- 📈 **MACD Line**: Difference between fast and slow EMA
- 〰️ **Signal Line**: EMA of the MACD line itself (smoothed momentum)
- 📊 **Histogram**: Visual difference between MACD and Signal lines

### 💪 [RSI — Relative Strength Index](../../../financial-theory/technical-indicators.md#rsi)

An **oscillator** (0–100) that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes. In FX, values above 70 may suggest the currency pair is overbought, below 30 suggests oversold. Useful for spotting potential reversals.

### 📏 [Bollinger Bands](../../../financial-theory/technical-indicators.md#bollinger-bands)

A **volatility envelope** around the price. The bands widen during volatile periods and contract during calm periods. In FX, a rate touching the upper band may signal overbought conditions, while touching the lower band may signal oversold.

- 〰️ **Middle Band**: Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- 🔺 **Upper Band**: SMA + 2 standard deviations
- 🔻 **Lower Band**: SMA − 2 standard deviations

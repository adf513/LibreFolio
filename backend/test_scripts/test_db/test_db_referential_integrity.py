"""
Database Referential Integrity Tests

Tests ALL foreign key CASCADE behaviors, UNIQUE constraints, and CHECK constraints.
This comprehensive test suite ensures:
- CASCADE delete behaviors work correctly
- RESTRICT behaviors prevent unwanted deletions
- UNIQUE constraints prevent duplicates
- CHECK constraints enforce business rules

Test Coverage:
- Asset deletion cascades (PriceHistory, AssetProviderAssignment)
- Asset deletion restrictions (Transactions)
- Broker deletion restrictions (CashAccounts, Transactions)
- CashAccount deletion cascades (CashMovements)
- Transaction ↔ CashMovement integrity (already tested, kept here)
- All UNIQUE constraints
- All CHECK constraints (using check_constraints_hook)

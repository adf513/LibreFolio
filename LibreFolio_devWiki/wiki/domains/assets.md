# Domain: ASSETS

> LibreFolio's financial instrument catalog — track any asset across a dozen types, fetch prices from multiple providers, and analyse performance with charts and technical signals.

## What it does

An asset in LibreFolio is a financial instrument: a stock, ETF, bond, crypto, commodity, fund, or structured product. Users create assets by searching a multi-provider autocomplete (yfinance and JustETF searched in parallel) that auto-fills the name, currency, type, and sector — or by entering details manually. Once created, a data provider is assigned: yfinance (ticker-based), JustETF (ISIN-based), CSS Scraper (arbitrary web page), or Scheduled Investment (for loans and structured products with predefined payment schedules). The provider assignment form is dynamically rendered from each provider's `params_schema` — no hardcoded UI for each provider type.

Price sync fetches OHLCV data (open, high, low, close, volume) and stores it one record per day. The 5-layer cache system prevents redundant provider calls: a 15-minute cache for history fetches, a 2-minute cache for current price (supporting frontend polling without hammering providers), and separate caches for metadata and search results. Thread isolation ensures sync calls never block the FastAPI event loop — each provider call runs in a dedicated thread with its own event loop, allowing providers to use synchronous I/O libraries directly.

The asset detail page is the richest view in LibreFolio: a full price history chart with the complete signal overlay system (EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, FX pair comparison, asset comparison, benchmarks, measure tool), an inline data editor for adding/correcting prices and events via click, CSV, or form, a provider comparison modal showing differences between provider data and stored data, and a metadata refresh button. Asset events — dividends, splits, interest payments — are displayed as markers on the chart and will be linked to transactions once Phase 7's event-transaction link is complete.

## Key decisions that shaped this domain

- [[decisions/provider-registry-decision]] — `@register_provider` decorator means adding a new data source is a single-file operation; no manual configuration or startup registration needed.
- [[decisions/scheduled-investment-redesign]] — the Scheduled Investment provider was redesigned as a **pure deterministic engine** with no DB access: given a schedule definition, it computes the full synthetic price series on demand. This eliminated a class of stale-data bugs from the earlier design.
- [[decisions/three-phase-pipeline]] — bulk sync operations use a PREPARE→FETCH→PERSIST pattern with per-task sessions to avoid the "transaction is closed" SQLAlchemy error that occurs when concurrent tasks share an async session.
- [[decisions/data-editor-unification]] — the inline data editor was unified into a generic `DataEditor` component set shared by both the FX and Asset detail pages, eliminating duplicated logic for click-to-edit, CSV import, and bulk save.
- [[decisions/price-currency-hard-reject]] — Phase 7 Part 3: hard-400 on any price-currency mismatch in `upsert_prices_bulk`; HTTP 409 on `Asset.currency` PATCH while price/event history exists.
- [[decisions/policy-d-currency-wipe]] — when the user accepts the 409, currency change is destructive: prices + events wiped symmetrically, transactions preserved with `asset_event_id = NULL`. Pre-confirm snapshots via [[entities/backup-router]] (`/api/v1/backup/asset/{id}/{prices,events}`).

## Known problems / limitations

- [[problems/asset-sync-transaction-closed]] — bulk asset sync previously failed with "This transaction is closed" under concurrent commits on a shared session; resolved by per-task session isolation (three-phase pipeline).
- [[problems/asset-list-500-provider-input-type]] — asset list endpoint returned 500 when an asset had `ProviderInputType.AUTO_GENERATED`; resolved by correcting the enum mapping in `FAinfoResponse`.
- [[problems/asset-currency-mismatch]] — asset price currency may differ from `Asset.currency` (e.g. a EUR-denominated ETF with prices returned in USD by yfinance); per-row currency column added in 2026-04 (still present as forensic canary), now superseded at the API contract level by [[decisions/price-currency-hard-reject]].
- [[problems/assets-wipe-error-attr-mismatch]] — Policy D wipe handlers used non-existent `e.code` attribute; fixed in G-batch6 (one residual occurrence flagged).
- [[problems/babel-currency-symbol-echo]] — `normalize_currency` echoed unknown garbage via babel; fixed via strict pycountry lookup in G-batch7.

## What comes next

- [[F-051]] Transaction ↔ AssetEvent Link — Phase 7: link `AssetEvent` records (dividends, splits) to `Transaction` records for accurate income tracking.
- [[F-029]] Metadata Refresh — already implemented but not yet documented; mkdocs page planned.
- [[F-036]] Provider Comparison Modal — already implemented; mkdocs page planned.
- [[F-094]] Sync Date Range Dialog — let users choose the historical range when syncing.
- [[F-095]] Asset Delete — Transaction Count Link — show transaction count before delete confirmation.
- [[F-096]] Scheduled Investment — Decoupled Frequencies + Anchor Day — idea for finer-grained schedule control.

# ![](../../../static/icons/transactions/fee.png){: width="32" style="vertical-align: middle;" } Fee & Tax

**Fees** and **taxes** represent costs that reduce your portfolio value. They are separate transaction types to distinguish between broker-charged costs and government-imposed obligations.

## 📐 Impact on Returns

Fees and taxes directly reduce your net return. The relationship between gross and net performance:

$$
R_{net} = R_{gross} - \frac{\text{Fees} + \text{Taxes}}{V_{start}}
$$

Where:

- $R_{gross}$ = return before costs (what the market gave you)
- $R_{net}$ = return after costs (what you actually keep)
- $V_{start}$ = portfolio value at the start of the period

### 📉 Compounding Effect of Fees

Over long holding periods, even small recurring fees erode returns significantly due to **compounding drag**:

$$
V_{final} = V_0 \times (1 + r - f)^n
$$

Where:

- $V_0$ = initial investment
- $r$ = annual gross return rate (e.g., 0.07 for 7%)
- $f$ = annual fee rate (e.g., 0.01 for 1%)
- $n$ = number of years

!!! example "The 1% drag over 30 years"

    With $10,000 invested at 7% gross return:

    - **Without fees**: $10,000 × $(1.07)^{30}$ = **$76,123**
    - **With 1% fee**: $10,000 × $(1.06)^{30}$ = **$57,435**

    The 1% annual fee costs you **$18,688** — a 26% reduction in final value.

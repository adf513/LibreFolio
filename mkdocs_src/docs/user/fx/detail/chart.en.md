## 🔀 View Modes

Toggle between two display modes using the toolbar:

- 📈 **Absolute** — Shows the raw exchange rate values (e.g., 1 EUR = 1.0845 USD). Best for seeing actual rate levels.
- 📊 **Percentage (%)** — Shows the percentage change from the first visible data point. Best for comparing relative movements and overlaying multiple signals.

When switching to % mode, all overlay signals are also recalculated as percentages from their respective starting points.
